# Petrol_logbook
This is a simple project to keep log of your car's fuel usage. I used Python and sqlite3 toe build everything, as well as the python library tKinter to build a GUI for the program
To run, you need Python3, tkinter, and sqlite3 installed.
sqlite3 should be installed when installing Python.

There will be 2 scripts. 
database.py will create the database, and then by running logbook.py, the program can run.
